This is the Tutorials for different Technology and Open Source. Here is the basic tutorial to create a **Markdown file**...


1.   **Headings** - H1 is #, H2 is ##, ..., H6 is # repeated 6 times
2.   **Paragraphs** - Use new line
3.   **Unordered List** - Place three spaces after *, + or -
4.   **Ordered list** - Place three spaces after number 1, 2,...
5.   **Bold and Italics** - *hello, world* italicized text and **hello, world** boldface
6.   **Strikethrough** - uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this~~
7.   **Link** - Format is *[Desc...] followed by (link.. title..)* e.g. [Markdown Cheatsheet Link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheatsheet")
8.   **Images** -
Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]
[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"
9.   **Code and Syntax Highlighting** - For Inline Code use "`" around the code and for syntex use "```" in the beginning and at the end.

  Inline `code` use `back-ticks around` it.
  ```javascript
  var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
  alert(s);
  ```
10.   **Blockquotes** - Blockquotes are represented with '>' followed by text

    > Here is the sample of Blockquotes
11.   **Horizontal Rule** - Three or more Hyphens, Asterisks, or Underscores in new line
